## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete student records.
- Utilizes an SQLite database for data storage.
- Offers a text-based menu interface for user interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external database server required (SQLite is included in Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to start the program:

2. The program displays a menu with options for CRUD operations. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage student records.

3. The SQLite database file (`student_database.sqlite`) is included in the project directory, making it self-contained. No separate database server setup is required.
